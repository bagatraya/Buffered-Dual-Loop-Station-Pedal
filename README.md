# Buffered-Dual-Loop-Station-Pedal
A project showcasing the design and development of a Buffered Dual Loop Station Effect Pedal, using the TL074 op-amp for low-noise buffering and inverting circuits. This repository includes the schematic, PCB design, simulation files, and a detailed project report.

## Features  
- **Buffered Input and Outputs**: Maintains signal integrity with low-noise TL074 op-amps.  
- **Phase Inversion**: Switchable inverting circuit for phase adjustment on Return 1.  
- **Signal Blending**: Blend potentiometer to control the balance between two return signals.  
- **Live-Tested**: Successfully used in live performance settings.  

## Repository Contents  
- **Hardware**: Schematic, PCB designs, and Bill of Materials (BOM).  
- **Simulations**: Proteus simulation files and results.  
- **Photos and Demos**: Images and video of the build and live testing.
